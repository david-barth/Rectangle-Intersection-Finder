Strategy for Technical Assignment: UNITELABS


Order of Focus: (BDD approach for now). 

	1.  Code the infrastructure for converting JSON files to a data streams that can be processed by the program.  
	
		A.  Convert JSON to rectangle objects and store these in an ArrayList. 
		
	
	2.**  Code up the basic implementation (Bruteforce) for the IntersectionReporter algorithm for 1 JSON file. 
	
	3.**  On successful completion of desired output from example file, implement defensive programming procedures in order to prevent errors and deal with all use cases. 
	
		A. This includes creating unit test suites for each class in order to test functions on all use cases. 
		
		B. In tandem with test suites, the implementation of try-catch blocks to handle erroneous use cases should be done on all levels of the program. 
		
			I. Test on function / unit level to ensure that individual Algorithm Implementation and JSON conversion procedures work correctly. 
			
			II. Test on software level (ie highest level) to ensure different types of JSON file test cases are covered correctly. (Implement black-box styled testing). 
			
			
	
	4.*  Adapt the core project files to a Maven project build and integrate the project functionality to commandline execution.  
	
		A. Important: Figure out how to modify structure so that Maven classpath includes all the necessary files. 
		
		B. Ensure that maven build procedure works for the project and that project functions well. 


	5.  Refine and adapt according to best practices as necessary, according to project instructions and personal research. 



*Represents the minimum that must be achieved by project deadline. 
**Interchangeable steps bepending on whether TDD or BDD approach is desired.
